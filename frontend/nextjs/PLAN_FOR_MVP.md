          Figure 1: Geographic distribution of AI funding (2019-2024). 
          Note the concentration in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt.

      </Figure>
      <Analysis>
        Our analysis of 2,467 funding events reveals significant 
        geographic disparities, with 83% of tracked funding concentrated 
        in four countries, while Central African nations receive less 
        than 2% despite representing 180 million people.

      <Analysis>
        Healthcare applications receive 5.8% of AI funding despite 
        the continent bearing 25% of global disease burden. 
        Agricultural technology, employing 60% of Africa's workforce, 
        attracts only 3.9% of funding.

## Design Principles

### 1. Academic Aesthetic
- Clean, journal-style layouts
- Numbered figures with proper captions
- Data tables instead of flashy graphics
- Muted color palette (grays, blues, subtle accents)
- Georgia or similar serif fonts for body text
- Sans-serif for data visualization

### 2. Information Hierarchy
- Lead with research questions and findings
- Support with methodology
- Data visualization serves analysis, not marketing
- Clear citations and sources

### 3. Language Style
- "Our analysis reveals..." not "Discover how..."
- "Research findings indicate..." not "See the shocking truth..."
- "Request access" not "Get started now!"
- "Methodology" not "How it works"

### 4. Trust Signals
- Last updated timestamps
- Data source citations
- Methodology transparency
- Research team credentials
- Peer review status where applicable
- Version control for datasets

This approach positions TAIFA-FIALA as a serious research initiative that happens to have built powerful technology, rather than a tech platform trying to appear academic. The focus is on contributing knowledge to the field, with the understanding that good research attracts sustainable funding from organizations that value evidence-based decision-making.
