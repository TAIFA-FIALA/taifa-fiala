 • Subscribe to newsletters from accelerators, tech hubs, and innovation labs (e.g., MEST Africa, CcHub, Baobab Network).
 • Monitor LinkedIn and Twitter accounts of major African VCs, angel networks, and startup competitions for informal or rolling calls.
 • Join regional startup communities and Slack/WhatsApp groups where calls are often shared before public posting.
