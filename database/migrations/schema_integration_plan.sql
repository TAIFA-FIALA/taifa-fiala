/*
Schema Integration Plan: Connecting CRM/Projects/Financial with Funding Intelligence
=====================================================================================

This migration connects the new comprehensive CRM/Projects/Financial schema with
the existing funding intelligence system to create a unified database for
"All AI in Africa" - covering organizations, people, projects, funding, and intelligence.

INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
1. Connect existing funding_opportunities with new projects and contacts
2. Link organizations with comprehensive contact management
3. Integrate financial tracking with funding intelligence
4. Create unified views for complete business intelligence
5. Maintain backwards compatibility with existing systems

TARGET OUTCOME: 
A unified database system that serves as the comprehensive source of truth for
the entire African AI ecosystem.
