## Integration Notes

All tools are designed to work together as part of the TAIFA-FIALA system:

1. **Dashboard** provides real-time monitoring and visualization
2. **Ingestion tools** collect and process data from various sources
3. **Demo tools** showcase system capabilities
4. **Migration tools** help maintain and update the system

The tools maintain their original functionality while being better organized for maintainability and scalability.
