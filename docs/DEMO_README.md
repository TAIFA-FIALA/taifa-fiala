   - Real-time updates

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Demo Points for Rwanda

#### Technical Sophistication
- **44 Data Sources**: Daily automated collection (not per-user API calls)
- **Offline-First Search**: Instant local database search, no internet dependency
- **Bilingual AI**: Professional EN â†” FR translation system
- **Smart Processing**: Relevance scoring, deduplication, validation
- **Production Ready**: Docker, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, real domains
- **Cost Efficient**: Scheduled collection vs. expensive real-time API calls

#### Local Relevance
- **Rwanda Focus**: Specific searches for Rwanda opportunities
- **Regional Coverage**: East African collaboration opportunities
- **Language Support**: English â†” French for regional accessibility

### ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

#### Backend Issues
```bash
# Test database connection
python -c "import psycopg2; print('DB OK')"

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

#### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Check Streamlit installation
streamlit --version

# Restart Streamlit
cd frontend/streamlit_app && streamlit run app.py
```

#### Environment Issues
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep SERPER
cat .env | grep DATABASE
```

### ðŸŽ¤ Demo Script Outline

#### Opening (30 seconds)
> "TAIFA means 'nation' in Swahili. We're building this for all African nations, starting with solving a real problem: funding discovery is fragmented across 44+ sources, often in English only, updated irregularly. Let me show you how a researcher in Kigali could find AI funding opportunities in seconds, in their preferred language."

#### Backend Demo (2 minutes)
> "Let me show you our daily collection engine. Every morning, TAIFA automatically searches 44 sources for new funding opportunities. Here's what happened this morning..."
> 
> [Run demo_rwanda_pipeline.py]
> 
> "Notice the intelligent processing - relevance scoring, geographic filtering, deduplication. This runs daily in the background, so users never wait for API calls. In areas with limited internet, this is crucial."

#### User Experience (2 minutes)
> "Now the user experience - this is what a researcher in Kigali sees..."
> 
> [Open Streamlit, navigate to Rwanda Demo]
> 
> "Watch the search speed - instant results because we're searching our local database, not the internet. And here's our bilingual interface serving both Anglophone and Francophone Africa..."
> 
> [Demonstrate fast search, language switching]
> 
> "No internet dependency for search. Fresh data daily, instant access always."

#### Integration Showcase (1 minute)
> "Finally, our ecosystem approach. New opportunities automatically flow to collaborative tools like Notion, enabling institutional workflows and community building."

#### Closing (30 seconds)
> "This is production-ready today. We have real domains, professional infrastructure, and 44 sources actively feeding the system. For Rwanda, this could centralize funding discovery for the University of Rwanda, government ministries, and the growing tech ecosystem. The foundation is built - now it's about partnerships and impact."
