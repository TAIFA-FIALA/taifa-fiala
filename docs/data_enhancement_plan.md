# TAIFA Data Collection Enhancement Plan
*Implementation started: July 11, 2025*

## üéØ Immediate Priorities (Next 48 Hours)

### Phase 1A: Fix & Expand RSS Sources (Priority: CRITICAL)

#### Current Issues to Fix:
- IDRC RSS: 404 error on https://idrc-crdi.ca/en/funding/funding-opportunities/rss
- Science for Africa: 404 error on https://scienceforafrica.foundation/feed/
- Gates Foundation: 404 error on https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/rss/

#### Action Plan:
1. **Research correct RSS/feed URLs** for each organization
2. **Add 20+ new verified RSS sources** from our comprehensive list
3. **Implement backup web scraping** for organizations without RSS
4. **Add social media monitoring** for real-time announcements

### Phase 1B: Enhanced Search & Discovery (Priority: HIGH)

#### Serper Search Expansion:
- Add country-specific searches (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, etc.)
- Include foundation-specific queries (Gates + AI + Africa)
- Add academic funding searches (NIH, NSF international programs)
- Search for recent announcements (last 30 days filter)

#### New Collection Methods:
- **Email monitoring system** for funding newsletters
- **PDF document processing** for funding announcements
- **API integrations** where available (Devex, GrantSpace)
- **Social media monitoring** (Twitter/X, LinkedIn organization pages)
